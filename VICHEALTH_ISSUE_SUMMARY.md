# VicHealth.vic.gov.au Issue Summary

## Problem
The vichealth.vic.gov.au website doesn't have an accessible sitemap.xml and blocks most CORS proxies when trying to crawl it.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Sitemap Issues
- ‚úÖ robots.txt is accessible (via api.allorigins.win)
- ‚ùå No sitemap.xml exists at any common location
- ‚ùå When fetched through proxies, sitemap URLs return HTML error pages (likely 404s)

### 2. CORS Proxy Compatibility
Testing revealed different proxy behaviors:

| Proxy | Sitemap Fetch | Homepage Crawl | Issue |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| corsproxy.io | ‚ùå 403 Forbidden | ‚ùå Network Error | Blocked by site |
| api.allorigins.win | ‚ö†Ô∏è Returns HTML | **Should work** | Returns error pages for non-existent files |
| cors-anywhere | ‚ùå 403 Forbidden | ‚ùå 403 Forbidden | Blocked by site |
| proxy.cors.sh | ‚ùå 403 Forbidden | ‚ùå Network Error | Blocked by site |
| codetabs | ‚ùå Network Error | ‚ùå Network Error | Connectivity issues |

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Proxy Priority Change
Reordered CORS proxies to try api.allorigins.win first since it's the only one that works with .gov.au sites:

```javascript
const CORS_PROXIES = [
  'https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=',  // Now first - works with gov sites
  'https://proxy.cors.sh/',
  'https://api.codetabs.com/v1/proxy?quest=',
  'https://corsproxy.org/?',
  'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/'
];
```

### 2. Rate Limiting Adjustments
Government sites often have strict rate limiting:
- Reduced batch size from 5 to 3 pages
- Increased delay between batches from 500ms to 1000ms

### 3. Enhanced Error Detection
Added detection for HTML error pages being returned instead of XML:
- Checks for "404", "403", "Error" in responses
- Properly identifies when a proxy returns an error page

## How to Test

### 1. In the App
1. Enter `vichealth.vic.gov.au` 
2. When sitemap fails, click "Start Website Crawl"
3. Watch the console - it should now use allorigins proxy first
4. The crawler should successfully fetch the homepage and start discovering links

### 2. Using Debug Tools
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
// Test all proxies with vichealth
CrawlerDebug.testProxies('https://vichealth.vic.gov.au')

// Run a small test crawl
CrawlerDebug.testCrawl('https://vichealth.vic.gov.au', 2, 10)

// Check crawler state
CrawlerDebug.getState()
```

### 3. Test Files
- `test-vichealth-specific.html` - Comprehensive testing for this specific site
- `test-allorigins-debug.html` - See what allorigins actually returns
- `test-crawler-debug.html` - Full crawler testing UI

## Expected Behavior

With these changes:
1. ‚úÖ Sitemap fetch will still fail (no sitemap exists)
2. ‚úÖ User will see option to crawl instead
3. ‚úÖ Crawler will use api.allorigins.win proxy
4. ‚úÖ Homepage should load successfully
5. ‚úÖ Links will be discovered and crawled progressively
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Crawling will be slower due to rate limiting protection

## Known Limitations

1. **No Sitemap**: The site genuinely doesn't have a sitemap.xml
2. **Rate Limiting**: Government sites may throttle requests
3. **Incomplete Crawl**: May not discover all pages without a sitemap
4. **Proxy Reliability**: api.allorigins.win may occasionally fail

## Monitoring

Watch for these in the console:
- "‚úÖ Success with allorigins!" - Proxy is working
- "Found X links" - Link discovery is working
- "üìã Queued X new links" - Crawl is progressing
- "‚ùå ALL PROXIES FAILED" - All proxies blocked (unusual now)
